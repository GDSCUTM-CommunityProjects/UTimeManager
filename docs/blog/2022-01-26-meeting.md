- Went through a bit of boilerplate code that I set up with eslint and prettier
- Went through (very roughly) Docker and Docker-Compose
- Went through project structure hierarchy
- Finalized the frontend and backend subteams (Can swap freely but we'll stick to this for now)

### Team Action Items
- See Github issues and assign tasks for team action items (Feel free to book any 1:1's with me if you're stuck! ðŸ™‚ )
- For any completed tasks that require a PR please assign myself as well as another person from another subteam to be reviewers

### Mentor Action Items
