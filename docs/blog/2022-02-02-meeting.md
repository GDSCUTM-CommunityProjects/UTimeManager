### Today's Meeting Recap
- Went through the documentation repository with the group
  - Basically it'll be adding in any new folder (if needed) in /docs and adding in the markdown files
- Went through live standups with both subteams

### Team Action Items (Same as last week)
- See Github issues and assign tasks for team action items (Feel free to book any 1:1's with me if you're stuck! ðŸ™‚ )
- For any completed tasks that require a PR please assign myself as well as another person from another subteam to be reviewers

### Mentor Action Items
- Fix up Docker-compose file before merging docs into the develop branch
- Setup documentation website on Netlify or some other hosting service
- Review any PRs (if any)
