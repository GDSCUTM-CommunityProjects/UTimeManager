## Meeting Recap

<!-- truncate -->

### Today's Meeting Recap
- Frontend - UI PR should be done by tonight
  - Other frontend items on Github should be started by the weekend (Including API registration layouts)
- Backend - PR for the login should be done by Friday night/Sat morning (if done early, we can get started on the API's needed for the calendar part of the system)
- Went through live standups with both subteams
- Went through a quick demo of useEffect (mainly with dependencies with the API), two way data binding with inputs and axios single instances (Refer to the code above as a reference!)
- Should schedule a meeting with Professor Ilir in 2 weeks (We should have the login complete as well as the calendar portion started (It would be good to have something to show for this))

### Team Action Items (Same as last week)
- See Github issues and assign tasks for team action items (Feel free to book any 1:1's with me if you're stuck! ðŸ™‚ )
- For any completed tasks that require a PR please assign me as the reviewer (So that I get the notification and can do the reviews asap)
- Be sure to update the documentation such that the frontend and backend are aware of what limitations there might be (i.e. If there's a character limitation to the passwords, please include it in the documentation and let the others know as well!)
- Remember to do your standups for Friday and next Monday!
- Remove the .env file (add it to a .gitignore file) and generate another key to invalidate the old one

### Mentor Action Items
- Review any PRs (if any)

### Resources
- https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html - For some information regarding the useEffect hooks (ctrl f for dependencies and give that portion a read)
